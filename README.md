# POB HarperDB Hackathon App

Check out some cool pictures from our attempt at building a client:

This inventory table shows all items in the inventory
![inventory-1](inventory-1.png)

We started adding sorting features
![inventory-2](inventory-2.png)

And then when the customer was ready to borrow some items they were advanced to our checkout forms
![checkout](checkout.png)
![newcustomer](newcustomer.png)

Part of this Angulare 2 Client is functional (the table).
We didn't have enough time to complete the Checkout process but we gave it our best attempt in the time possible. Angular 2 was new to most of the team.
